# BIG_Communities

Data and code for the manuscript **“Identity‑by‑descent captures shared environmental factors at biobank scale.”**  
Pre‑print: <https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.03.652048>

This project is part of the **Biorepository, Informatics & Genomics (BIG) initiative at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center**.  
Project home: <https://uthsc.edu/cbmi/big/>

## What’s in this repository?
- **aggregated data & scripts** to reproduce the analysis at biobank scale. Identity‑by‑descent (IBD) clustering.  
  - four continent‑scale genetic communities, and  
  - seventeen sub‑communities that share both genetic architecture and distinct environmental exposures.  
  - A **shiny dashboard** (`app.r`) to interactively explore genetic, environmental and health patterns at sub‑community resolution.

## Mapping BIG
Here we can explore the spatial correlation between the relatedness based communities (can be interpreted as big families composed by distant relatives). In the example we see pollution (PM 2.5) and a specific community C2 (mostly African ancestry).

## Exploring health conditions across communities
Here we can see the health conditions and the prevalence within different communities in order to compare them.

## Communities, environment and health conditions

Here we can explore genetically related individuals (communities) with shared enviromental and health conditions, aiming to inform decision making in public health.

Note: The final dashboard will be deployed in a web, at this stage the data are for illustrative purposes
