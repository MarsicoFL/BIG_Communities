# BIG_Communities

Data and code for the manuscript **“Identity‑by‑descent captures shared environmental factors at biobank scale.”**  
Pre‑print: <https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.03.652048>

This repository is part of the **Biorepository, Informatics & Genomics (BIG) initiative at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center**.  
Project home: <https://uthsc.edu/cbmi/big/>

**Live dashboard:** <https://francomarsico.shinyapps.io/BIG_Communities/>

## Highlights
- Identity‑by‑descent (IBD) clustering at biobank scale, summarising four continent‑level communities and seventeen sub‑communities.
- Aggregated environmental indicators (for example PM2.5) aligned to the same ZIP code geography used for the communities.
- Interactive Shiny application to compare communities, exposures, and health outcomes side by side.

## Repository contents
- `app.r` – Shiny dashboard that ties together the data layers and visualisations.
- `data/` – Aggregated data products used by the dashboard (no individual‑level records).
- `rsconnect/` – Deployment metadata for shinyapps.io.

## Getting started locally
1. Install R (≥ 4.3) and RStudio or your preferred IDE.
2. Install the required packages:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "shinyWidgets", "shinydashboard", "shinydashboardPlus",
  "leaflet", "leaflet.extras", "sf", "geojsonio", "dplyr", "tidyr",
  "readr", "DT", "ggplot2", "viridisLite", "plotly", "tibble",
  "forcats", "stringr", "RColorBrewer"
))
```

3. Launch the dashboard from the repository root:

```r
shiny::runApp(".")
```

The app reads the pre‑computed objects in `data/` by default. No credentials are required.

## Data notes
- All data are aggregated to protect participant privacy; counts are filtered so that ZIP codes with fewer than 100 individuals are removed from the map.
- Environmental layers (for example PM2.5) come from public sources referenced in the manuscript; see the pre‑print for complete methodology.
- If you need to regenerate any tables, follow the scripts bundled in `data/` or reach out via the contact below.
